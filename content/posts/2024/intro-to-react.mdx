# Introduction to React: Building UI with Components

React has revolutionized the way we build user interfaces. Let's explore some key concepts:

## What is React?

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications. It's all about:

- Component-based architecture
- Virtual DOM for performance
- Declarative UI design

## Key React Concepts

1. **Components**: The building blocks of React applications
2. **Props**: How components communicate
3. **State**: How components manage and react to data changes

## Your First React Component

Here's a simple React component:

\```jsx
import React from 'react';

function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}

export default function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Welcome name="Alice" />
      <Welcome name="Bob" />
      <Welcome name="Charlie" />
    </div>
  );
}
\```

## Why Choose React?

- **Reusability**: Components can be reused across your project
- **Performance**: Virtual DOM optimizes rendering
- **Community**: Large, active community and ecosystem
