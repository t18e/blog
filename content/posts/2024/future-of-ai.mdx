# The Future of AI: Predictions for 2024

As we step into 2024, the field of Artificial Intelligence continues to evolve at an unprecedented pace. Here are some key predictions for the year ahead:

## 1. Advancements in Natural Language Processing

We expect to see significant improvements in:

- Language understanding
- Context-aware responses
- Multilingual capabilities

## 2. AI in Healthcare

AI is set to revolutionize healthcare through:

- Early disease detection
- Personalized treatment plans
- Drug discovery acceleration

## 3. Ethical AI and Governance

This year will likely bring:

- Stricter regulations on AI use
- Increased focus on AI transparency
- Efforts to reduce algorithmic bias

## Code Example: Simple AI Model

Here's a basic example of a neural network in Python:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
