[**Perplexity AI**](https://perplexity.ai) started the year with a $500 million valuation and is closing 2024 with a $500 million round at a $9 billion valuation. Perplexity aren't just building a better search engine, but I believe they’re building what might eventually shape up to be the most defensible moat across the browser search market. 

Their recent Stripe integration 'Perplexity Shopping' signals this: the possibility of inline purchases directly from search results is certainly compelling. We're about to see yet another wave of startups trying to solve previously difficult consumer problems with AI - flight & hotel deals, appointment scheduling, restaurant bookings, etc. Most of these will essentially become Perplexity wrappers, even if their APIs offer some differentiation. This isn’t inherently a bad thing, but relying on this alone would be tough. Nonetheless, Perplexity is positioning itself as the layer that sits above all of them. The $500m seems justified.

Perplexity is winning search for a few reasons:
* Hybrid model of conversational AI + traditional search creates a "best of both worlds" approach where users get precise answers but maintain broad discovery ability.
* Its emphasis on citation transparency and clear sourcing positions it as a powerful research tool: critical for academia, finance, healthcare, etc.
* The focus on direct answers rather than link lists reduces cognitive load and time-to-answer – key given rapidly declining attention spans.

However, I’m not sure whether or not I see Perplexity getting acquired. Moreover, I’m not sure if this would even be a good thing. We recently discovered acquisition attempts by [**X, Microsoft, and OpenAI**](https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/microsoft-x-openai-discussed-buying-perplexity) which were evidently all rejected by Perplexity.

I actually think a Google acquisition could be somewhat viable: 
* Switching browsers is inherently difficult, and most people wouldn't want to even if presented with other solutions. 
* Google already has iPhone distribution – though users increasingly find it unreliable – and Perplexity's $50m revenue is still relatively low given its potential
* Google's Gemini is decent, but is unlikely to match what I expect Perplexity could become in a few years. Google's infrastructure combined with Perplexity's tech stack could be pretty transformative. 

But as we know, acquisitions often stifle what makes startups special. The more interesting path might be Perplexity acquiring or partnering with a browser. I can pretty easily imagine a paid, ad-free version of Google Chrome & Google Workspace powered by Perplexity. 

It’s no secret that PPLX are onto something pretty incredible, and the next few years could be quite interesting. An integration with Stripe is possibly the first of many, and I wouldn’t be surprised in the least to see Shopify, Salesforce and Meta jump in with partnerships in the near future.
