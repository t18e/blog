Newton's first law states that every object will remain at rest or in uniform motion in a straight line unless a force causes the velocity to change. The concept is fairly simple to understand and can be used as a metaphor in several scenarios. 

To ask whether inertia is 'good' or 'bad' in the context of human behaviour seems redundant; inertia is often a choice determined by one's consciousness anyway. Also, inertia has little downside risk: per Newton's law, the object doesn't simply remain unchanged, but does so in a straight line. In most cases, we choose to leave things as is due to the low downside involved (the straight line). Things would be different if inertia involved remaining unchanged — up to a certain point — before a rapid, catastrophic decline. Instead, complacency is familiar, and familiarity breeds complacency, and so on. The way to avoid this cycle is to expand the inertial gap and reduce one's propensity to inertia.

My thoughts on this were inspired by a thread on product inertia as an unforeseen occurrence when ideating or launching to market. The common advice regarding building is to focus on solving problems. It's good advice, but I fear it's a gross oversimplification. I've worked on two products this year which we failed to validate. The first was a restaurant booking tool in a country with manual booking options i.e. call or text to book. The second was an automated accounting solution for a niche within the MSME market — the current alternatives in this market are manual reconciliation or expensive outsourcing. We failed to validate not because the products didn't solve problems, but because people didn't want them. I'm of the view that people know what they want, and duly act in their best interest (often, if not always). This applies to everything from travel to dating. While there are some cases where people can be convinced, this often works when they're at least on the fence or stuck between two options.

In both cases, we explained the value proposition to over 20+ businesses each and none seemed interested. Of course, you could say maybe it's bad timing, or poor communication, or anything else. This is likely not the case, if we're following the view that the simplest explanation is most preferable [1]. Instead, people simply didn't want what we were building and nothing we could've done or said short of begging them would've worked. Many such cases. This is one of the reasons why I prefer the specificity of the YC ethos "make something people want" to merely products that solve problems [2]. We've seen time and time again products that defy the age-old dictum of problem <> solution. But, what ultimately matters is what people want, and more importantly, will pay for. [3]

On product, my focus now is on low- vs high-friction channels. You can't always tell if a solution is desired or not, but low-friction means less guesswork regarding users' product inertia. I don't consider the time spent on this year's projects a waste, but my preference is always to act with conviction. Low-friction channels enable this in a much shorter timespan.

[1] Occam's razor is a principle often attributed to 14th-century friar William of Ockham. It states that if you have two competing ideas to explain the same phenomenon, you should prefer the simpler one.

[2] It's Y Combinator's motto and a maxim for innovation in general. The idea is that a) people know what they want, b) if you build something truly awesome, c) users will want it, and hopefully pay you for it.

[3] Distribution is a secondary consideration as long as a product fulfills the necessary condition that people want it in the first place.
