I've spent the last few months using Claude extensively – for everything from coding to product specs to analysis. – and recently purchased a Pro subscription. OpenAI’s ChatGPT excels at information retrieval and quick tasks, but Claude regularly demonstrates a more nuanced understanding of context and analytical thinking. Both are excellent, but serve different purposes, and I tend to use both at different times almost daily.

I’m a huge advocate of Claude, but it remains relatively obscure despite its capabilities. Frankly, most people outside the tech bubble haven’t heard of Claude or Anthropic. Meanwhile, ChatGPT sees roughly 20 million monthly downloads.

Anthropic's recent Times Square billboards feel particularly bland and indicative of their low-effort marketing. It's slightly reminiscent of early cloud computing ads that focused on showing off their technical specifications to a broad user base without a care in the world.

Even with its robust API offerings, Claude is fundamentally a consumer product and more users = more revenue. More importantly, more users means data to improve the model. Many now defunct tools won on product, but lost on marketing, distribution and speed. I really hope this doesn’t happen here.
