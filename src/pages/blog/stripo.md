Today, Stripe is the 4th most valuable private company in the world with a valuation of ~$70 billion, following a successful Series I round – yes, you read that right – in March 2023. Most VC-backed companies, following the conventional lifecycle, would raise venture funding in the early-stage (pre-seed to Series A), scale (Series B to Series C) and eventually later stage (often Series D-F) before proceeding to IPO. Massive enterprises like Stripe have gone public before reaching later rounds like Series E or F. Case in point: Uber, Twitter, and Zoom all opted for an IPO after raising large Series D rounds.

Stripe has raised over $9 billion across 19 funding rounds since its inception – with the latest being a $6.5 billion Series I round at $50 per share. It's easy to see why investors and enthusiasts alike have been speculating about its future, with rumours about an IPO looming for years. Most private companies at their scale would have gone public years ago. Stripe doesn't need to. They could pretty easily go public tomorrow, but are firmly choosing not to despite conventional wisdom about the necessity of IPOs.

If Stripe were to go public, I believe we could expect an 8-9x multiple (2x above industry standard), while at the same time accounting for dilution discounts. This could result in a valuation ranging from just above their $95 billion peak private valuation from 2021 to just shy of $145 billion. Although recent high-scale fintech IPOs such as Robinhood and Klarna have experienced post-IPO valuation cuts, I don't expect Stripe to receive a discounted valuation given its strong operating metrics and cemented market position.

However, going public could present complications, such as increased governance (due to inevitable restructuring), and regulatory pressures heightened by its recent acquisitions of companies like Paystack (Africa), Recko (India), and LemonSqueezy (U.S.-based, but with users >135 countries). Also, Stripe’s recent $1bn acquisition of Bridge signals an adoption of USDC for its merchants’ online checkout pages. 

A divestiture seems unnecessary, and a stock buyback could drain capital. Meanwhile, remaining private provides unparalleled product freedom minus the scrutiny and regulatory burdens of public markets. It seems like a no-brainer.

Stripe is in a uniquely comfortable position to decide whether or not to go public, and understandably so: after building a profitable and cash-flow-positive payments titan – likely beyond their wildest dreams – the Collison brothers have earned their stripes...and can now do whatever the hell they want.
