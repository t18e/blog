[**Friend**](friend.com) infamously launched earlier in the year when news broke of their [**$1.8m domain purchase**](https://www.404media.co/ai-friend-company-spent-1-8-million-and-most-its-funds-on-domain-name/). At the time, it seemed wild and potentially quite ridiculous. I didn't think so; if anything, the marketing ROI from the internet buzz probably justified the spend given how difficult wearables are to launch. Also, I felt the name tied quite nicely into a much-needed product: a device to address and combat loneliness. It almost instantly struck me as an AI-powered companion similar to Samantha in _Her_, the 2013 film by Spike Lee. [1]

I know consumer hardware is tricky, and most companies have failed in recent years. The way I see it, most seemed cool rather than enjoyable to use – even if not necessarily ‘useful’. Contrary to popular opinion, [**Humane’s AI Pin**](https://humane.com) seems like a pretty decent product for what it is. [**Rabbit’s R1**](https://www.rabbit.tech), on the other hand, is a different story.

Months later, it seems Friend is still set on wearables, but is experimenting a pretty weird chat feature. Now, when you open the website, you’re met with an avatar – presumably a ‘friend’ – who chats with you. The concept strikes me as intended to be offbeat, but it borders on off-putting and juvenile. The issue isn’t with the feature in itself, but with the characters being positioned as young and edgy. I'm not sure who's meant to like this, and more so who's meant to use this.

I’m aware it’s just a film, but Her serves as a blueprint of a sort, and the Friend team could’ve taken some notes. [2] I really believe there’s a promising space and would still love to see a generation of Friend products akin to how Apple’s products align with each other. Friend launched at a time where many people – young and old – would at least _try_ a product that curbed loneliness even marginally. Perhaps this is still in the works, and the placeholders on the website are a red herring. I can't fathom why that would be the case, but I certainly hope there’s more in store.

[1] I actually rewatched the film when news broke of OpenAI’s 4o launch earlier this year. I highly recommend. 

[2] Perhaps the most obvious observation is how the relationship in "Her" evolves naturally through shared experiences and conversations, rather than starting at full emotional intensity. Any AI companion should similarly allow relationships to develop gradually and authentically. Hopefully, Friend corrects this.
