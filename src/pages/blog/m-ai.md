Harvey just raised a $100m Series C at a $1.2bn valuation while Hebbia raised $130m for AI-powered document search. The legaltech sector is evolving into its own category, but unlikely to disrupt the traditional legal services market itself. Big Law firms like are building proprietary tools and startups are focused on creating key infrastructure.

The AI tools could definitely assist with due diligence and contract review, but less so with negotiations and core advisory elements. Nonetheless, I expect the next wave of legaltech tools to mirror AI agents able than ever to perform key tasks alongside associates. For example, pre-empting client responses and spot patterns across thousands of similar deals. If done right, these tasks could dramatically accelerate deal velocity. The impacts on M&A volume could be staggering, particularly for mid-market deals that currently collapse from friction rather than strategic misfit. I'm also curious to see the impact of AI-powered legal advisory on capital markets more broadly due to the nature of cross-border transactions. 

I expect we'll see more partnerships between companies building complementary products. However, these may only be few due to the sensitivity surrounding privacy & data regulatory compliance. LLMs mark just the start for the sector, and the growing funding across multiple geographies signals a the possible restructuring of the legal sector itself â€“ No pun intended.
