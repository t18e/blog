# About

I'm a software engineer and CEO of Vercel. I'm originally from Lan√∫s, Buenos Aires, Argentina. I owe much of my career to the Web and Open Source.

I spent my early teens advocating for and teaching people how to use Linux and later developed a passion for JavaScript and Web development.

After joining the MooTools core team, I got my first full-time job as a frontend engineer at 18 years old and relocated to San Francisco, CA.

## Technical contributions

- I contributed to MooTools as part of their core team and led the development of the MooTools Forge package repository.
- Created Socket.IO, which became one of the most popular JavaScript projects on GitHub
- Authored Mongoose, the MongoDB ODM for Node.js
