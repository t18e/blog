## Projects
Here are some things I’ve worked on over the last year...

* Brade: Plug-and-play automated accounting for the beauty service industry. Promising, but failed to validate.
  
* Almanac: Reddit-style forum for alumni Q&As, mentorship & career networking. I built this for my alma mater.

* Leftwrite AI: Self-learning writing & publishing companion built for Substack. Open beta TBD.

## Tools
Here are some things I’ve built for myself...

* Frugal Friday helped monitor my spending limit on Black Friday. A few friends also found it useful.
 
* Lean Screen calculates my annualised screen time. LS was inspired by the GitHub commit tracker.
