## About
Here’s a bit about me…

* Studying: Politics @ UCL with a focus on neocolonialism, innovation policy & political economy. 

* Building: Leftwrite AI as a fun way to connect with other Substack writers. Sign up to our beta.

* Reading: _Why We Die_ by Venki Ramakrishnan


## Projects
Here are some things I’ve worked on recently...

* Leftwrite AI: Self-learning writing & publishing companion built for Substack. Open beta TBD.

* Brade: Plug-and-play automated accounting for the beauty service industry. Promising, but failed to validate.
  
* Almanac: Reddit-style forum for alumni Q&As, mentorship & career networking. I built this for my alma mater.


## Tools
Here are some things I’ve built for myself...

* Frugal Friday helped monitor my spending limit on Black Friday. A few friends also found it useful.
 
* Lean Screen calculates my annualised screen time. LS was inspired by the GitHub commit tracker.



## Writing
I publish my thoughts on Substack every week. Here are a few of my favourite posts...

* **[Savings or Current](https://shortdecades.com/p/savings-or-current)**: Reflections on naive Nigerian patriotism.
  
* **[Discontent](https://shortdecades.com/p/discontent)**: Discussing the implications of the social- network/media dichotomy.
  
* **[African Intelligence](https://shortdecades.com/p/african-intelligence)**: Foreshadowing the assetisation of Afrobeats through a neocolonial lens.

* **[Yeah, Write](https://shortdecades.com/p/yeah-write)**: On writing & agency in the technosphere.



## More Writing
I occasionally write about startups I admire and my learnings as a first-time founder...

* **[Less is MRR](https://t18e.com/less-is-mrr)**: Why simplicity wins.
  
* **[Perplexed City](https://t18e.com/perplexed)**: The moat GOAT.
  
* **[StrIPO](https://t18e.com/stripo)**: Series I > IPO.
  
* **[On Claude 9](https://t18e.com/claude-9)**: Marketing means more.
  
* **[Friend Request](https://t18e.com/friend-request)**: Please fix, thanks.
