    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Reading:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Why-We-Die-Science-Immortality/dp/152936924X"><strong>Why We Die</strong></a> by Venki Ramakrishnan to learn more about ageing, consciousness & biology.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Building:</strong> <a href="https://leftwriteai.com"><strong>Leftwrite AI</strong></a> in my free time as a fun way to connect with other writers and writing teams on Substack. Open beta TBD.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Writing:</strong> I publish my thoughts on <a href="https://shortdecades.com"><strong>Substack</strong></a> every week.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>More Writing</h2>
    <p>I occasionally write about startups I admire and my learnings as a first-time founder <a href="https://t18e.com"><strong>on here</strong></a>.</p>

    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Brade:</strong> A plug-and-play automated accounting tool for the beauty service industry. Salons currently pay accountants to manage their finances and help file their taxes; we built Brade to do this at 1/10th of the cost in 1/1000th of the time.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Almanac:</strong> A Reddit-style forum for alumni Q&As, mentorship & career networking. I built this for my alma mater and should launch this early next year.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Frugal Friday:</strong> A simple tool to monitor my spending limit on Black Friday. A few friends also found it useful.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Lean Screen:</strong> A simple tool to help me calculate my annualised screen time. LS was largely inspired by GitHubâ€™s commit tracker.
